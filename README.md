💬  I am a french digital strategist based on Montpellier. I help entreprenors to improve their visibilty and grow their business.

🐈  Fun fact: Like cats, I've got 9 lives : I am hairdresser, saler, paramedics, flight attendant, owner of an ice cream shop, webdeveloper... without having bachelor graduate.

🔨  I’m currently working on to create the new website of the architecte Célia Argilés Baró that will be soon available !

🎤  I love learning and teaching others:
I gave free tips on how to use Instagram for businesses on my [Instagram Account](https://instagram.com/sabine.caizergues) and one conference on Google Atelier Numerique which attracted more than 70 people: 20 tools to improve your IG account. 

👩🏼‍🤝‍👩🏿  As a woman entrepreneur, I am also an ambassador of #SheMeansBusiness facebook program for the south of France.
